# stm32-nrf24-remote-car_side
I had remotely controlled car with STM via nrf24 2.4ghz module in my university years. I diveded the two repo this project. This part is rx side (its means car side ). 
I did not have used NRF24 full efficiently because i didnt know how to use other pipe and I tried to send the command (Right Left and Forward, Back) from a pipe.
